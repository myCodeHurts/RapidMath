    &#8226 Square root of an odd n-digit number has (n+1)/2 digits before decimal point. In case of even number of digits, results has n/2 digits.<br><br>
    &#8226 Start by grouping digits from right to left in pairs of two, and draw a vertical line reaching the most significant digits<br><br>
    &#8226 Write down the square root of the number to the left of the line and twice as the divisor<br><br>
    &#8226 Henceforth, the technique is similar to division, except that every climb operation subtracts the V(.) of the numbers after the vertical line (refer to multiplication for V(.))<br>
